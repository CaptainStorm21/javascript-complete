Interpreter
  * we translate and read the file s line by line
  * interpreted and compiled because it has to run it has to be interpreted and it also has to most likely
   get translated into something low level like machine code for example.

Transpiler/Compiler
  
  * compiles down to usually a language that can be understood by our machines.
  
  
 We have a high level language here like Javascript and we run a piece of code here an interpreter will
take this code line by line and spit out bite code like this that will execute this code for us or a
compiler might take this code and go through this and spit out machine code just like that so that it
can give it to a CPSU so that the CPU can actually run the code but remember how

Babel is a Javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and returns  browser compatible JS (older JS code).
Typescript is a superset of Javascript that compiles down to Javascript.


Google came up with JIT and solved the problem with 
interpreter - starts up fast but processes slow
compiler - starts slow but processes fast

Code gets sent to the interpreter and in the V* engine. This is called ignotion.  It takes this SSD and splits out byte code. 
byte code is code that is not as low level as machine code but it is the code that is able  interpreted by the JS engine in order to run our prog
