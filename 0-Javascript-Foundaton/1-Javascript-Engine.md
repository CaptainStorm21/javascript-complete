Javascript Engine
  const isHappy = true;

The computer only understands ones and zeros at the end of the day.
And when we give it the javascript file it's like me talking to a computer in French 
and the computer.

V8 was released in 2008. Google had a problem with speed of Chrome maps so Google released Chrome browser 
which is faster than all thers.

So anytime we use an engine we're able to give it a javascript file and this javascript file gets understood 
by the engine and it allows this engine to communicate and tell the machine the 
computer to do what we ask it to do with JavaScript.

V8 reads the code and runs it

Engine breaks the code into tockens to id their meaning. these tokens are transformed into ATS abstract synthanx tree
we pass the code that is we are trying to figure out the flow.
